# ducks-CNN
CNN models for predicting ducks especies

This was a project made for the discipline of AI in UFMS, the code probably won't work since i didn't make it portable _it uses my google drive to get all the training images_, anyhow i figured it would be interesting to share it.

A live demonstration can be found in telegram by a bot called **@duckington_bot**, just send it a picture and it will give you the duck species

The project was trained using 2000 different duck photos
